1.Sensors controlling the servo
schematic diagram：



##code
 int switchState = 0;
void setup(){
 pinMode(3,OUTPUT);
 pinMode(4,OUTPUT);
 pinMode(5,OUTPUT);
 pinMode(2,INPUT);
}
void loop(){
 switchState = digitalRead(2);
 if (switchState == LOW) {
 digitalWrite(3, HIGH);
 digitalWrite(4, LOW); 
 digitalWrite(5, LOW); 
 }
 else { 
 digitalWrite(3, LOW);
 digitalWrite(4, LOW);
 digitalWrite(5, HIGH);
 delay(250); 
 digitalWrite(4, HIGH);
 digitalWrite(5, LOW);
 delay(250); 
 }
} 





2.Connect your Servo Motor and make it move
schematic diagram：




##code

#include <Servo.h> 

int servoPin = 3;

Servo Servo1;

void setup() {
  Servo1.attach(servoPin);
}

void loop(){
  Servo1.write(0);
  delay(1000);
  Servo1.write(90);
  delay(1000);
  Servo1.write(180);
  delay(1000);
}
