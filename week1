# week1-progress

In the first week, we learned how to make the light turn on, which was very interesting. Based on this, I tried the effect of making the light flash



code
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
pinMode(LED_BUILTIN,OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  
digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH); 
delay(1000); 
digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW); 
delay(1000);
}
