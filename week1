# week1-progress
Complete Projects 1 and 2 in the Arduino Project Book

## Project Components
Arduino Uno
LED
220Î© resistor
Breadboard
Jumper wires
In the first week, we learned how to turn on the light, which was very interesting but still difficult for me as a beginner. I tried many times before I succeeded. On this basis I tried to make the effect of small lights flashing

## Circuit Diagram







##code
// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup() {
  // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(12, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(11, OUTPUT);

}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(13, HIGH);  
  digitalWrite(12, HIGH);
  digitalWrite(11, HIGH);// turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);                      // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(13, LOW);
  digitalWrite(12, LOW);
  digitalWrite(11, LOW);   // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);                      // wait for a second


 for (int brightness = 0; brightness <= 255; brightness++) {
    analogWrite(13, brightness);
    analogWrite(12, brightness);
    analogWrite(11, brightness);
    delay(10);
}
  for (int brightness = 255; brightness > 0; brightness--) {
    analogWrite(13, brightness);
    analogWrite(12, brightness);
    analogWrite(11, brightness);
    delay(10);

}}
