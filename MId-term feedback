MId-term feedback
1.The first of the two most useful pieces of feedback would be to improve the change in colour of the light strip. My current light strip colour change is too monochromatic and it's hard to get a feel for the music in terms of colour, it might be more noticeable with intense music but not with a change to softer music the colour change in the light strip is not as noticeable. If I want my work to be used in more occasions I need to make changes. The second feedback is that the pumpkin shape could be improved. Right now in the artwork people can easily see the light strips inside through the eyes and mouth of the pumpkin, obviously this is not perfect, I should add a layer of soft paper so that the light strips can be better hidden.
2.The biggest challenge I encountered was that the led strip I chose was too long, my computer and batteries couldn't get all 144 bulbs on the strip to light up as the colour of the lights kept jumping around due to the unstable voltage, which made it hard to unify the music with the changes in the lights. Secondly, the sound sensor is not very sensitive at first, the sound of the music has to be very loud and wait for the colour to change, the sensitivity value of the sound sensor must be in a reasonable range to make the work more ornamental, which took me a long time to debug!
