Week Three
1.Soldering Practice 

Project Overview：
In this week’s exercise, I practiced basic soldering techniques as part of my physical computing coursework. The goal was to become familiar with the process of soldering electronic components onto a PCB (Printed Circuit Board) and to learn best practices for creating durable, clean solder joints.

Materials Used：
Soldering iron
Solder wire
PCB board
Jumper wires
Electronic components (LEDs, resistors)
Safety equipment (gloves, goggles)
I welded for a long time because I was very worried about safety for the first time

2.DIY Bend Sensor
I experimented with my device with the most basic code, and it didn't go as well as expected. I succeeded only with the help of my friends
schematic diagram：






##code
int sensorPin = A0; 
int sensorValue;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);  
}

void loop() {
  sensorValue = analogRead(sensorPin);  
  Serial.println(sensorValue);  
  delay(100);  
}
