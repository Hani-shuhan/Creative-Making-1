Week Three
1.Soldering Practice 

Project Overview：
In this week’s exercise, I practiced basic soldering techniques as part of my physical computing coursework. The goal was to become familiar with the process of soldering electronic components onto a PCB (Printed Circuit Board) and to learn best practices for creating durable, clean solder joints.

Materials Used：
Soldering iron
Solder wire
PCB board
Jumper wires
Electronic components (LEDs, resistors)
Safety equipment (gloves, goggles)

I welded for a long time because I was very worried about safety for the first time

2.Lab Report

Project Overview：
In this lab, I explored various foundational concepts in physical computing, including [briefly mention the main concepts, like working with sensors, microcontrollers, or basic circuit assembly]. This hands-on experience helped reinforce key skills in wiring, coding, and troubleshooting basic circuits.
